## UX
---
### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

JDR's target users are:
* Aged 30+
* People interested in living a heathier lifestyle
* People who already living a healthy lifestyle

What these users would be looking for:
* Clear, concise, easy-to-find information
* Beautiful photos that provide inspiration and make the food look delicious
* Recommendations for what to eat

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. An effort was taken to not provide an overwhelming amount of information at first glance as this is often the reason people are put off with this kind of websites.

It is assumed that most users will be viewing the site on their mobile phones and therefore creating something responsive is integral to the design.

### **Scope**

In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features will be included in this release:

- Header and menu bar, to navigate to various sections of the page
- Gallery of images and videos with some of our delicious products
- Newsletter sign up form
- Links to affiliate social media pages

### **Structure** 

This is a four pages website. First page is the home page, which will give the users enough information about what our business is doing; the navigation bar at the top allows for users to easily move to whatever page of the site they are interested in or they can scroll down where our social links can be found. I chose the following order for the information 'Home > Explore JDR Products > Sign up to the JDR Newsletter, whcih after submitting will send you to a thank you page', as I felt this would allow the information to be digested in the best way. The second page is the "Explore JDR Products", which will contain videos from all our three brands, pictures with some delicious ideas of toppings and recipes followed by the social media links at the bottom. Finally, there is a simple sign up form for users to sign up to the JDR newsletter.

### **Skeleton**

Whilst building the website, at first I added random pictures with all our branded products, later I realsied that it was not easy to understand what all our brands mean and what products they are offerning, than I decided to organise and have sections with videos followed by pictures for each brand and I believe it looks much better now and it makes more sense.

### **Surface**

I chose a colour palette based around green & white as these colours remind me of the nature and it's in line with our new motto: "Together we inspire better wellbeing by creating delicious foods from nature".

---

## **Features**

This is a fully responsive website that was designed for all devices like laptops, desktops, tablets and mobile phone. 

### *Navbar*
The navbar is placed on the middle of the header and it turns into a dropbox for smaller screen sizes

### *Home page paragraph*
This is where I introduce the JDR company with a short paragraph: "At Jordans Dorset Ryvita, we’re all about helping people around the world live healthier lives whilst minimising our impact on the world around us, and it’s our three brilliant brands that allow us to do this. Be it Jordans Cereals, Dorset Cereals or Ryvita: all three make great tasting, honest real food which we’re really proud of.", followed by an animated image, the company's motto and our social media links.

### *Explore JDR Page*
This page starts with another paragraph about our company:"At Jordans Dorset Ryvita, we have a strong heritage of making whole grain foods and working with farmers to protect the countryside. Ever since our brands first came together, we have continued to act on these values. We believe that natural foods that have been lightly processed are generally better for you –they tend to be higher in fibre, vitamins and minerals, and they taste great too! Our Brands have a long-standing commitment to health and sustainability, and we have so much to be proud of.", followed by some beautiful images and videos about our products and the social media links.

### *Sign up to the JDR Newsletter page*
This page is about signing up to our JDR Newsletters which will redirect the user to another "Thank you for signing up page".

## Testing

### **User Stories**

1. **As a first-time visitor, I want to easily find useful information & tips for travelling/backpacking.**  
As soon as you enter the page you can easily see within the navbar the 'Travel Tips 101' section; upon clicking this you are taken to a section filled with tips on various elements of travelling/backpacking.

![](docs/images/travel_tips_user_story.png)
![](docs/images/travel_tips_user_story_2.png)

2. **As a first-time visitor, I want to find inspiration for planning future trips.**  
The page is designed to immediately inspire, the photo in the heading allows for the user to be transported to thoughts of being away. As you scroll further down the page the tips and tricks provide key info for planning future trips; this is followed by 'My Last Trip', this section is started with another emotive photograph, combined with the information on Sri Lanka will stimulate inspiration. 

![](docs/images/inspiration_user_story.png)
![](docs/images/inspiration_user_story_2.png)
![](docs/images/inspiration_user_story_3.png)

3. **As a first-time visitor, I want to find a helpful guide on Sri Lanka, with possible routes to take and options of places to visit available.**  
As soon as you enter the page you can easily find the 'My Last Trip' button in the navbar, clicking on this link will take you straight to the Sri Lanka guide and review. Embedded in this section is a map of the route taken by the author and there are options within this section of things to do. If a user isn't immediately looking for this section they might be guided by the link in the 'About' section.

![](docs/images/sri_lanka_user_story_2.png)
![](docs/images/sri_lanka_user_story_3.png)

4. **As a recurring or first-time visitor, I want to find recommendations from a trusted source for restaurants/hotels/products.**  
Within the 'Travel Tips 101' section I have provided clickable links for any products that have been mentioned with clear recommendations as to why they are useful/good. A user interested in hotel recommendations will find these easily within the Sri Lanka route section as these are linked at the beginning of each destination. Where possible I have also provided links and recommendations for great food that was eaten. 

![](docs/images/recommendation_user_story.png)
![](docs/images/recommendation_user_story_2.png)

5. **As a recurring or first-time visitor, to easily find affiliate pages for the author, with even more inspiration available.**   
All social media icons can be found in the footer of the page, linked directly to those of the author.

![](docs/images/social_media_user_story.png)

6. **As a first-time user, I want to be able to sign up to directly receive content via a newsletter.**  
The 'Keep in Touch' button is found in the navbar, upon clicking this the user will be taken to this section towards the end of the page. In this section is a newsletter sign up form for the user to register their interest. The form was built using the required attribute so all fields are necessary to 'Sign Up!'.

![](docs/images/newsletter_sign_up_user_story.png)

### **Lighthouse**

Lighthouse is a feature of Google Chrome developer tools and is used to assess the performance of the website and its features. I achieved a low-performance score initially, as you can see below:

![](docs/images/first_lighthouse_report.png)

I made a conscious effort to increase this by reducing image sizes on smaller screens using the 'srcset' and 'sizes' attributes & I also deferred any CSS or JS that wasn't required for the first paint. Furthermore, I added the 'rel="noreferrer"' to all external links as this is considered best practice. 

I am very pleased to now hit above 90 for all scores:

![](docs/images/final_lighthouse_report.png)

### **HTML and CSS Validation**

I validated both my HTML and CSS code multiple times whilst building the website, I did this so that there were not a huge amount of errors/warnings at the final stages of development for me to deal with. This allowed me to incrementally improve my code and upon completion, there were 0 errors found. 

![](docs/images/css_validation_no_errors.png)
![](docs/images/html_validation_no_errors.png)

### **Known bugs and fixes**

As part of my testing I wanted to ensure that all of my clickable links worked & opened up in a new page, I found that two of the links when clicked gave a 404 error message:

![](docs/images/error_404_message.png)

This has now been resolved and all of the links work.

Throughout the entire process, I used Google Dev Tools and Unicorn revealer to debug the website and its layout, this allowed me to check the responsiveness of the site and quickly debug any issues that I came across. 

I also used a number of Accessibility tools in order to design a fully accessible website, this brought up some issues and so I had to make some big changes to the colour scheme. The website was initially designed in turquoise but this failed the contrast validator:

![](docs/images/contrast_test_failed.png) 

So I decided to change the main colour to a darker blue to improve the overall accessibility, which passed the contrast validator with no issues:

![](docs/images/contrast_test_passed.png)

Accessibility was also tested in WAVE, initially, I had some errors due to insufficient labelling for my form elements and a link within the navbar:

![](docs/images/wave_errors.png)

 using the report I made the necessary changes and the website now passes with no errors:

![](docs/images/wave_no_errors.png)

In addition to testing that I conducted I got my friends, family & fellow students to test the website on their phones/laptops/tablets/desktops and provide feedback on anything they felt didn't work or look right, this enabled me to debug any issues that I might not have otherwise found.

## Deployment

I deployed this website by using GitPages and following the below steps:

*GitHub pages deployment* 

1. Log in to GitHub
2. In your Repository section, select the project repository that you want to deploy
3. In the menu located at the top of this section, click 'Settings'
4. Select 'Pages' on the left-hand menu - this is around halfway down
5. In the source section, select branch 'Master' and save
6. The page is then given a site URL which you will see above the source section, it will look like the following: 

![](docs/images/git-pages-published.png)

Please note it can take a while for this link to become fully active. 

*Forking the GitHub Repository*

If you want to make changes to your repository without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This ensures your original repository remains unchanged.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button (under your account)
3. Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to work on

*Cloning the GitHub Repository*

Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning can also be a great way to backup your work.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. Press the arrow on the Code button
3. Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
4. Now open Gitpod & select the directory location where you would like the clone created
5. In the terminal type 'git clone' & then paste the link you copied in GitHub
